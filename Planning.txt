- Need to store these values in Chrome local storage 


Settings Section
- Enable notifications checkbox
- View logs button
- View Github Repository














To Do:

Register a Chrome developer account


Update version history and other stuff on the manifest

Collect URLs of other people who use Excel online

Suppress "looks like your screen isn't optimized" or something

Add custom options to kill specific Strings and how many levels up from that String to kill

Add method to automatically reload when the session expired popup comes up

Separate the popup into different sections of things so it isn't overwhelming when it is first opened

Create a better custom-made icon for the extension


Create a default settings.json for startup


Cancel sign on Excel symbol instead of a pacifier (red)
Thicken lines in Excel right symbol
Fill in the back with light gray?




Create new Github Repository and add to LinkedIn and resume





NEED TO MAKE SURE SO NO CONFLICT WITH THE SERVICES AGREEMENT:

Make it clear in the extension description that users have control over what gets blocked, and make sure no important functionality is being suppressed.
Make sure users understand that they are choosing to suppress non-essential notifications and not essential features.
For transparency, consider including a Privacy Policy with the extension that explains how any data (if any) is handled.

Clear Descriptions: On your extensionâ€™s page on the Chrome Web Store, clearly state that this extension allows users to suppress non-essential pop-ups and provide full transparency about which pop-ups can be suppressed.
